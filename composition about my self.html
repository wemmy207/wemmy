<p> Hailing from a working class family,
	        I am simple,sweet,gentle,
		confident and cunning
		 fellow. My father is a lecturer
		 at kwara state university of malete
		who knows how to love his 
		profession with passion and dedication.
		While my mother is a hardworking
		 teacher at city public school
		 whoose only passion is to transform the lives 
		of her students with knowledge and a good vision.</p>
<p>That's i have learned from the very start,
		the importance of passion,
		 dedication,confidence and time management.
		We are four brothers and sisters
		 among our parents and my grandmother.
		My family is what my parents had worked for,ie completely
		happy and satisfied one.</p>
<p>I am students of kwara state university of malete.
		Its true to say that a child becomes what the 
		environments he gets in his home.All the 
		essential humane qualities like sincerity,dedication,
		 truth and honesty i do experience 
		practically at my home.</p>
<p>Therefore, writing about myself,
		i am here to express myself what
		 i plan for my life is the total manifestation of what i do today.
		I try myself to be humble,passionate,
		 dedicated,hardworking and honest.</p>
<p>I deem my parents as being my best mentors.
		I have learnt the real meaning and worth of life from my parents.
		i am with a happy,focused and hardworking family.
		That is definitely the greatest blessing of God for me.</p>
